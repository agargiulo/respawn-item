# Respawn-item Bukkit Plugin

When loaded, every player that respawns receives one item, as configured in the config.yml file

# Use

```sh
[~] % cd /home/bukkit/craftbukkit/plugins/
[~] % wget https://github.com/downloads/agargiulo/respawn-item/respawn-item.jar
[~] % mkdir respawn-item && cd respawn-item
[~] % echo "item: 371" > config.yml
```

* If no config file is given, the plugin defaults to giving a gold nugget.
