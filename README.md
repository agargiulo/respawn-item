# Respawn-item Bukkit Plugin

When loaded, every player that respawns receives one item, as configured in the config.yml file

# Use
* Place [this jar](https://github.com/downloads/agargiulo/respawn-item/respawn-item.jar) in your Bukkit plugins folder
* Then make a folder called respawn-item and make a new file there, config.yml
* Format of file is:

```yaml
item: <hex code of item>
```

* If no config file is given, the plugin defaults to giving a gold nugget.
