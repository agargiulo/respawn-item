# Respawn-item Bukkit Plugin

When loaded, every player that respawns receives one item, as configured in the config.yml file

# Use

```sh
cd /home/bukkit/craftbukkit/plugins/
wget https://github.com/downloads/agargiulo/respawn-item/respawn-item.jar
mkdir respawn-item && cd respawn-item
cat << EOF > config.yml
item: 371
EOF
```

* If no config file is given, the plugin defaults to giving a gold nugget.
